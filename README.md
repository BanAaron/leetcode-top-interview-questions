# Caesar's Cipher 

Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher 
in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

In this example we use the increment of 1. A will become B, B will be become C and so on.

# Fizz Buzz

[FizzBuzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/) is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job 
interviews. The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about 
showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz 
are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100:

- if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
- if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
- else, print the number.

# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

[LeetCode 104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

# Number of Even and Odd Bits

[LeetCode 2595](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-even-and-odd-bits/)

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` (0-indexed) with value `1`.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` (0-indexed) with value `1`.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer = [even, odd]`.

# Palindrome Number

[LeetCode 9](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

# Two Sum

[Twos Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) is a problem in where you are given an array of integers `nums` and 
an integer `target`, then return indices 
of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

**Examples:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
