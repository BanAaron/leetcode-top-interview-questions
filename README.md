# Code Challenges

This is a collection of programming challenges I have completed. Mainly from LeetCode and interview question practice.

Python is my language of choice so all solutions are written so.

## Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[LeetCode 121](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future 
to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Caesar's Cipher 

Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher 
in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

In this example we use the increment of 1. A will become B, B will be become C and so on.

## Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

[LeetCode 28](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` 
if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

## Fizz Buzz

[FizzBuzz](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/) is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment 
to weed out non-programmers during job interviews. The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly 
according to the below rules and more about showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as 
if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100:

- if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
- if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
- else, print the number.

## Longest Common Prefix

[LeetCode 14](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

[LeetCode 104](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest 
leaf node.

## Number of Even and Odd Bits

[LeetCode 2595](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-even-and-odd-bits/)

You are given a positive integer `n`.

Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` (0-indexed) with value `1`.

Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` (0-indexed) with value `1`.

Return an integer array `answer` where `answer = [even, odd]`.

## Palindrome Number

[LeetCode 9](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## Roman to Integer

[LeetCode 13](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Two Sum

[Twos Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) is a problem in where you are given an array of integers `nums` and 
an integer `target`, then return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

## Valid Parentheses

[LeetCode 20](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
