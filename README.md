### [Check Whether Two Strings are Almost Equivalent](solutions/leetcode/check_almost_equivalent.py)

[LeetCode 2068](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-whether-two-strings-are-almost-equivalent/)

Two strings `word1` and `word2` are considered almost equivalent if the differences between the frequencies of each 
letter from `a` to `z` between `word1` and `word2` is at **most** `3`.

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, each of length `n`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are almost equivalent, or false 
otherwise.

The **frequency** of a letter `x` is the number of times it occurs in the string.

- `numNegOnes` items with `-1`s written on them.

We want to pick exactly `k` items among the available items. Return the **maximum** possible sum of numbers written on 
the items.

### [Left and Right Sum Difference](solutions/leetcode/left_right_sum_differences.py)

[LeetCode 2574](https://leetcode.com/problems/left-and-right-sum-differences/description/)

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a **0-indexed** integer array `answer` where:

- `answer.length == nums.length`.
- `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|`.

`| |` means absolute value. 

Where:

- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, 
 `leftSum[i] = 0`.
- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of the index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, 
`rightSum[i] = 0`.

Return the array `answer`.

to another digit.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum values Danny can make by remapping exactly one digit in `num`.#

**Notes:**

* When Danny remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Danny replaces all occurrences of `d1` in num with `d2`.
* Danny can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.
* Danny can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.
* The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.

- Only ids that appear in at least one of the two arrays should be included in the resulting array.
- ach id should be included only once and its value should be the sum of the values of this id in the two arrays. If the id does not exist in one of the two arrays then its value in that array is considered to be `0`.

Return the resulting array. The returned array must be sorted in ascending order by id.

## [Your order, please](solutions/codewars/your_order_please.py)

[Codewars Link](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c45be3b2079eccff00010f)

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

**Example**

```text
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""
```
