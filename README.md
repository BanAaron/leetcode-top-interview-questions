# Fizz Buzz

FizzBuzz is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment to weed out non-programmers during job 
interviews. The object of the assignment is less about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more about 
showing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as if-/else-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz 
are as follows:

For numbers 1 through 100:

- if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
- if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
- if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
- else, print the number.

#  Caesar's Cipher 

Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher 
in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

In this example we use the increment of 1. A will become B, B will be become C and so on.

# Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
