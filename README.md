## Two Sum

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Two Sum is a problem in where you are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, then return indices of
the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that:

1.  Each input would have exactly one solution.
2.  You may not use the same element twice.
3.  You can return the answer in any order.

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        store = {}

        for index, number in enumerate(nums):
            if target - number in store:
                return [store[target - number], index]
            else:
                store[number] = index

        def add(number):
            self.answer += number

        # inelegantly replace all the edge special cases with simplified versions. IV (4) becomes IIII (1,1,1,1) etc

<details>

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: list[str]) -> str:
        length = min(len(i) for i in strs)

## Valid Parentheses

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`, determine if the input string is
valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### [Solution](solutions/valid_parentheses.py)

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = ""
        valid_brackets = ("()", "[]", "{}")

        for char in s:
            stack += char
            if char in ")]}":
                if stack[len(stack) - 2:] in valid_brackets:
                    stack = stack[:-2]

        return len(stack) == 0

## Merge Two Sorted Lists

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

### [Solution](solutions/merge_two_sorted_lists.py)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next


class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: ListNode, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        new_list = dummy

        while list1 is not None and list2 is not None:
            if list1.val <= list2.val:
                new_list.next = list1
                list1 = list1.next
            else:
                new_list.next = list2
                list2 = list2.next

            new_list = new_list.next

        if list1 is not None:
            new_list.next = list1
        else:

## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique
appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements
in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were
- present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

### [Solution](solutions/remove_duplicates_from_sorted_array.py)

<details>

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))
        return len(nums)
```

## Plus One

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `ith` digit of
the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to the least significant in left-to-right order. The large
integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

### [Solution](solutions/plus_one.py)

<details>

```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: list[int]) -> list[int]:
        if digits[-1] == 9:
            if len(digits) == 1:
                return [1, 0]
            return self.plusOne(digits[:-1]) + [0]

        for price in prices:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_purchase)
            min_purchase = min(min_purchase, price)

        return max_profit
```
