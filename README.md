## Two Sum

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Two Sum is a problem in where you are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, then return indices of
the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that:

1.  Each input would have exactly one solution.
2.  You may not use the same element twice.
3.  You can return the answer in any order.

## Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique
appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements
in `nums`.

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were
- present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

## Merge Sorted Array

![easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-easy-brightgreen "Difficulty tag")

### [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, 
representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. 
To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be 
merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of `n`.

### [Solution](solutions/merge_sorted_array.py)

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: list[int], m: int, nums2: list[int], n: int) -> None:
